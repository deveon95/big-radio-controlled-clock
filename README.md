# big-radio-controlled-clock
A radio-controlled clock with jumbo 6" displays.

Originally built in 2012/13 and one of my first C Programming projects, so it's not representative of anything I write nowadays ;)

[Details of this project are on my blog.](https://nick-elec.blogspot.com/2020/01/6-inch-jumbo-radio-controlled-led.html)

../sketch_radio_controlled_clock is the firmware for the ATmega328p microcontroller in the design, and "../time from npl slave decoder for 20x2.bas" is the firmware for the PICAXE microcontroller which handles the Time from NPL (MSF) decoding.
